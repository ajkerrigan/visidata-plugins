    Combine dict into one, with assignments affecting a target dict
    The source dicts are combined so that early dicts in the list have higher
    precedence.
    Typical usage is ``SetPropagatingDict([locals, globals], locals)``. This
    is used for functions like ``rlcompleter.Completer`` and
    ``code.InteractiveConsole``, which only take a single dictionary. This
    way, changes made to it are propagated to locals. Note that assigning to
    locals only actually works at the module level, when ``locals()`` is the
    same as ``globals()``, so propagation doesn't happen at all if the
    debugger is inside a function frame.
